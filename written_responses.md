1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

Blocks consist of a reference to the previous block in the chain, whatever the transaction is and the hash. A block can only be added to the blockchain once it guesses the value of the hash. The hash that it needs to match is randomly generated which means finding a match can take time. Once the match is found the proof of work is sent to the network for validation and confirmation that a valid block was found. If the network validation returns a positive result then the block is included in the chain and the process repreats itself.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

Users can mine coins bases on the prinicple mentioned in my first answer. Since the hash is 'randomly' generated. Clients or users can work to try to guess the hash before others. If they do guess the hash they can add to the blockchain and therefore be rewarded with 'coins'. The more difficult the proof the more valuable coins become. 

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

Cellular automata can be used to model several physical and chemical reactions found in our world where some kind of 'nodes' has a predictable response based on state of it's neighbors. Some examples of this used in science is simulating the mechanism that plants use to regulate the lose and gain of gases and also simulating and exploring possible genetic combinations in DNA.
