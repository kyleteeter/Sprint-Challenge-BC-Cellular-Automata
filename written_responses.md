1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

Blocks consist of a reference to the previous block in the chain, whatever the transaction is and the hash. A block can only be added to the blockchain once it guesses the value of the hash. The hash that it needs to match is randomly generated which means finding a match can take time. Once the match is found the proof of work is sent to the network for validation and confirmation that a valid block was found. If the network validation returns a positive result then the block is included in the chain and the process repreats itself.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
